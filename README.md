OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Goal:
The objective of this project is to create a personal portfolio website to showcase your skills, projects, and experience. This website is a great way to learn and practice HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript while creating a responsive, modern web design.
Key Features:
Responsive Layout:

Design the layout to work seamlessly on various screen sizes using CSS Grid or Flexbox. This ensures that your website looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Navigation Menu:

Implement a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between different sections (e.g., About, Projects, Contact) within the website. Use smooth scrolling for better user experience.
Sections:

About Section: Provide an introduction about yourself, your background, and the technologies or skills you specialize in.
Projects Section: Display your projects with brief descriptions and images/screenshots of the work you've done. Each project can link to the full details (e.g., GitHub repository).
Contact Section: Include a form where visitors can fill in their name, email, and message to contact you directly.
Interactivity:

Use JavaScript to enhance user interaction, like smooth scrolling navigation and possibly a simple email form submission action.
Modern UI/UX:
